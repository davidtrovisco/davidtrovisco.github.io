###
And I've reached the end of the NoCodeFastTrack challenge from Nocode Institute.io! It's been two incredible weeks, full of learning and exciting discoveries in the world of NoCode. 
I dedicated myself to enhancing an application I had already created and decided to expand its presence by creating a complementary web page. 
Leveraging all my knowledge in UI/UX, I worked on the complete design of the page, aiming to provide an exceptional experience to users. 
I want to express my gratitude to the Nocode Institute.io for offering this amazing opportunity for growth and development.

###
For my final project, I decided to create a web page for an application (ThreeApp) that I had created a few years ago.

###
Pages created:
###
HomePage;
â€¢ About us;
â€¢ Investors;
â€¢ Safety;
â€¢ Sustainability;
â€¢ Careers;
â€¢ FAQs;
â€¢ Signup;
â€¢ Jobs;
â€¢ ComingSoon;
â€¢ AndroidApp;
â€¢ JuniorJob;
â€¢ SeniorJob;
###
Elements used:
###
â€¢ Navbar;
â€¢ Dot Lottie (Animations);
â€¢ Embed Html code;
â€¢ Countdown;
â€¢ Formspark;
â€¢ Intercom;
â€¢ Ticker;
â€¢ Locale Selector (Localizations);
â€¢ Memoji;
â€¢ Noise Pattern;

###
Functionalities:

Implementation of the BotChat in the bottom right corner, allowing users to ask various questions. The AI, Intercom, handles responses to facilitate user search through the chat.

Dashboard of the Bot Chat implemented, accessible only to the website admin. Admin can maintain the chat and create custom questions. The chat ID must be provided in framer.ai for proper functionality.
On the jobs page, users can respond to a questionnaire by providing their details (name, email, and answering the question). The Formspark ID must be provided for correct operation. Once all fields are filled, the data is sent to the FormSpark dashboard.

Implemented HTML code displays random usage statistics, such as the number of current users and their city/country, creating a sense of real-time usage. The page features various animations throughout.
Location Selector, specifically localizations, essential for displaying website languages. Only the Portuguese language was implemented, as English is already default.
###

Ideas:
In the future, the website will connect to a converted API. Since framer.ai only accepts API data via CSV, data from an external API will be implemented.
