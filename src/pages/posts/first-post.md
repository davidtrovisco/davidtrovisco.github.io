<h3 style="color: rgb(34, 211, 238); text-align: center;">IMC App - ReactNative</h3>

### Introduction
This is a simple application developed in React Native that calculates the Individual Mass Index (IMC) according to the userâ€™s height and weight.
 
### App Mockup 
<img alt="IMC App" src="/assets/images/imc_app.png">
As we can see in the mockup, we will only use TextInput, Text, and Button.
Very simple design, but I promise to make it more appealing! :)
